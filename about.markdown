# About

This website was created during [DiSSCo Prepare](https://www.dissco.eu/dissco-prepare/), a project to develop the Distributed System of Scientific Collections Research Infrastructure. DiSSCO will enhance the capacity for digitisation of natural science collections in Europe.

To read more about how this website was developed, see the "Digitisation Standard Operation Procedures" mid-project [report](https://know.dissco.eu/handle/item/412) and [final deliverable](https://know.dissco.eu/handle/item/510) report "DiSSCo Digitisation Guides Website - Consolidating Knowledge on Collections Mobilisation".

We are grateful to have also received funding from [COST Mobilise](https://www.mobilise-action.eu/) and the [UK Arts and Humanities Research Council](https://www.ukri.org/councils/ahrc/) (AHRC) to add and improve some of the guidance and workflows on the site.
