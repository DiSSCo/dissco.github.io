# Adding or Updating Workflows and Guidance

## Overview

There are two options to contribute to the site: You can either contact one of the site administrators ([dissco-uk@nhm.ac.uk](mailto:dissco-uk@nhm.ac.uk)) or you can directly contribute through our GitHub. All submissions will be reviewed before publication.

## New Workflows

We have created a [template](https://dissco.github.io/Template.html) to use when writing a workflow: most of the headings are optional, but please follow this structure rather than creating your own. This helps users to compare workflows, so they can choose the one which best suits their situation. You can either use this template as a basis for writing a workflow in a word processor, or you can contribute directly in GitHub (see below for more information)

The [BPMN page](https://dissco.github.io/Guidance/BPMN.html) provides guidance on how to create the workflow diagrams.

## New Guidance

Please [get in touch with us](mailto:dissco-uk@nhm.ac.uk) if you would like to contribute guidance to the site (there is no template for guidance, each page is different).

## Suggesting Edits to Existing Guidance

Suggestions to improve our guidance and workflows can either be made by e-mailing [dissco-uk@nhm.ac.uk](mailto:dissco-uk@nhm.ac.uk), adding an issue to our [GitHub Page](https://github.com/DiSSCo/dissco.github.io/issues) or by clicking the 'Edit this Page' link found at the bottom of all of our guides. These suggestions will be reviewed before publication.

## GitHub Contributions

New workflows can be submitted through the [DiSSCo Digitisation Guides GitHub](https://github.com/DiSSCo/dissco.github.io). You can do this by cloning or forking the repository, making your own changes, and then creating a pull request. We will then get a notification about your pull request, which will allow us to review the new workflow before we add it to the website.

We suggest using the [template page](https://github.com/DiSSCo/dissco.github.io/blob/main/Template.md) on GitHub as a starting point to writing your workflow. Markdown can be used for most of the formatting on a page, although you can use html as well.
