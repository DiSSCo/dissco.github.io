## Overview

This page details the step involved in the 'iCollections' single camera pinned insects workflow used at the Natural History Museum (NHM) London. This workflow produces images containing a single pinned insect specimen as seen from above, and its associated labels laid out on the right.

## Workflow

This workflow occurs in two separate stages. 
1. Specimens are taken from the collections in drawers for re-housing and curation. During this stage, a unique barcode is attached to the pin of each specimen. A record is created stating that that barcode is associated which that species, but no other information is collected. Records can be created in bulk if there are many specimens per species. 
2. Specimens are imaged. The specimen's labels and barcode are included in the image which allows information about the specimen to be gathered and link the image to the specimen record.

**Specimen Image Capture**

The imaging process takes place using several steps, where the specimen in passed between three locations:
* Its permanent location in its drawer tray.
* A plastazote sheet where specimen handling is performed.
* An imaging tray where the specimen and labels will be laid out for imaging.

First the specimen to be imaged is moved from is permanent location in the tray to the plastazote sheet. The specimen's labels are then carefully removed from the pin using forceps, and laid out in order on the sheet.

The specimen is next transferred from the plastazote sheet to the middle of the imaging tray.

The labels are placed on the right hand side of the specimen on the imaging tray, usually on a raised level so that the pinned specimen and the labels are at the same distance from the camera. This ensures that all parts are in focus.

Once the specimen and labels are in place, the tray is moved into the imaging station and orientated so that it is the correct way up for the camera. We preview the image using the live view from the tethering program on our computer.

If there is additional information on the reverse side of the labels we take a second image of these.

We then reverse the process: we move the specimen back onto the plastazote sheet. Labels are moved with forceps and laid out on the sheet as before. The labels are then reattached to the pin in the same order as they where originally found, by sliding the pin through the pre-existing holes.

Once complete, the specimen is returned to its location in the tray. 
 
**Specimen Image Processing**

Image processing is performed at the end of the day once all specimens have been imaged.

The processing involves using the unique barcodes associated with each specimen to re-name the images. The images are initially given generic names due to the order in which the image was taken. By re-naming the images we are able to identify each image and link the image to other information in the specimen's digital record.

To perform the re-naming step we use the program [BardecodeFiler](https://www.bardecode.com/en1/app/bardecodefiler/). More instructions can be found in our [Software](/Software/BardecodeFiler) page.
