## Introduction
The purpose of digitisation projects is to create a digital record of a specimen for data sharing, analysis, and cataloguing. A major part of digitisation is the creation of a visual image for each specimen. This image can then be stored and made available via an online portal which allows others, both within and outside our collections to access specimens without the need for direct contact with them. The digital image of the specimens also helps preserve it for prosperity and future generations in case the specimen is damaged.

Taking a photo is the simplest way to create a visual digital record of a specimen. Ultimately any photo, taken with any camera or setup, could count towards digitisation efforts:

IMAGES OF SPECIMENS OF VARIOUS DEGRESS OF USEFULNESS

While the above photos are digital representations of specimens, they do not provide the same degree of information. When producing specimen images for digitisation we need to ask ourselves ‘why are we taking this image?’ The information about the specimen that we want to capture affects the type of image we should create.

In digitisation we want to produce an image of high quality and standardisation which captures as much detail about the specimen as possible. This includes colour, morphology, date of collection, species, and additional label information. The more aspects of a specimen that can be, the more information can be extracted about the specimen without the need to handle the specimen itself. Including label data in the image allows more of the information connected to a specimen to be kept together and this simplifies later analysis.

![images exmaples](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/inset_and_plant.png?raw=true)

The aim of this module is to provide a general background to the use of photography for digitising museum specimens. We give an overview of many aspects of photography, from camera set up to automated photo editing. This module also introduces and explains many of the jargon terms in the photographic workflows detailed elsewhere on this site. The aim is for users to be familiar with technical terms used in workflows and understand why certain settings/specifications are recommended. The core message is that you do not need to be a photography expert to produce good digitisation images of your specimens, but a grasp of basic ideas will aid in workflow implementation, help you to understand the photography process and help resolve issues that may arise.

Photography as means for specimen digitisation is most efficiently applied to small or reasonably flat objects like herbarium sheets (link when ready), microscope slides, or pinned insects (link when ready). Each specimen type usually requires different set ups to produce the best picture of the specimen. However, with all the specimen types the aim of photography is still the same: to produce the highest quality and most informative digital image of a specimen that can be stored and distributed in a replicable and cost-effective manner.

In this module, we have several sections that will take you through various aspects of digital photography. This is not an exhaustive review, but should help those of you who are new to photography with your digitisation projects. If you’re interested, additional links are provided at the end of this page.

## Types of cameras
There are many types of cameras available. With the pace of technology, it can be very hard to keep pace with developments and what is right for you to use for your digitisation project. The most used type of camera used in digitisation workflows are SLR cameras, (Single Lens Reflex), modern versions of which are sometimes referred to as DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex). SLR cameras have been around for nearly 90 years and widely used by professional photographers for the [last 60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_F), with many of the defining images of the latter half of the last century being taken on 35mm film using an SLR. Some examples, showing the evolution of such cameras are shown below:

![SLr evolution](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/evolution_of_slrs.png?raw=true)


**Advantages of SLRs include:**
* Full control of all settings during taking of the photograph (we will discuss why this is important later)
* Convenient size for professional use - not too large or too small
* Interchangeable lenses for different situations (close-up, wide-angle etc)
* Can be connected to other accessories - e.g. studio flash units
* Optics are good enough to allow reasonably high resolution of detail

During the decade from 2000-2010 digital image sensors began to become available which had potential to replace traditional silver based film emulsions in regular cameras. Initially these were expensive, somewhat clunky factory modifications of existing film based cameras, and they came with numerous limitations, but very soon these problems were resolved, and prices began to drop to affordable levels which further hastened adoption levels. Today, digital has replaced film in all but a few very limited, niche applications.


Digital SLRs retain all of the features listed above, but by eliminating the use of film being in several extra attributes, such as:
* Live video feed from the sensor, which makes complex focusing and exposure scenarios much easier
* Instant preview of results via the LCD screen (now higher resolution than some TVs)
* Results automatically available in a form that can be stored electronically and shared via the internet
* Very low cost per photograph if the camera is used intensively (you might expect a lifetime from a quality camera body to be around 100,000 frames or more)

Arguably it is the last two points on this list which have been transformative in allowing off-the-shelf DSLR’s to be used in museum mass digitisation projects. It would be impossible to do the kind of things we are discussing here if using a film SLR.

While the SLR cameras are the most widely used for digitisation, any camera shooting in a raw format, with >12 megapixels and a video out jack, could feasibly be used. Recently, DSLRs are being superseded by mirrorless cameras such as the Panasonic SR1. However, these are very similar to DSLR cameras being almost indistinguishable for the average user, and simply represent the latest evolution of SLR type cameras. Mirrorless cameras are even frequently referred to colloquially as SLRs.

### What camera to choose?
The cameras used for digitisation do not need to be overly fancy and off the shelf SLRs costing around £2,000-3,500 new will produce images of high quality and are used in many specimen workflows. While other cameras with higher resolution and other features are available, such differences also come at a high price cost while not providing many substantial benefits for most digitisation projects.

For example, let's compare the two cameras shown below.

![side_by_side images of Hasselblad and Panasonic cameras](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/hassleblad_vs_panasonic.png?raw=true)

The left-hand image is of the H-system camera from Hasselblad, and is one of the most advanced DLSR cameras easily orderable online and is capable of taking 100 to 400 megapixels images. However, at a cost of $32,995 (not including lenses) this is far too expensive for most digitisation projects. Additionally, images of such high quality are generally unnecessary for specimen analysis and are difficult to store. Much cheaper options are often better, such as the Panasonic Lumix SR1 shown on the right and used in our ![herbarium workflow}(link when it's ready) (~£3,000). In summary, while these two cameras have a roughly 10-fold difference in cost, this does not translate into a ten-fold difference in image quality.

It is recommended to stick to one brand of SLR camera for your workflows. While camera design is quite conservative, there are differences between makes in their button layout, cable positioning, batteries, tethering programs etc. Sticking with one make means that cameras and their parts can be interchanged with minimal fuss. New versions of the cameras are frequently released, but often don’t result in large scale changes. Even if the model you are using is dis-continued you are still likely to get good replacement parts or hire specific pieces of equipment if you’re using one of the major brands. Sticking to one brand of camera within your institution also makes training new digitisers easier. The main SLR cameras are produced by Canon, Nikon, and Panasonic, but other brands exist too and are all fairly similar in appearance and in operating.

![conservative camera design](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/conservation_camera_design.png?raw=true)

Finally, remember that the best camera body in the world will not produce decent results if the attached lens is not up to the same standards, so you should budget for the lenses you will need in your calculations. Some cameras will be sold bundled with inexpensive “kit” lenses which are suitable for general photography, but you may also want to look at professional specialist lenses as well. In some cases, second-hand cameras or lenses could provide a more cost effective way to acquire the necessary equipment.

## Camera basics
Once you have decided on which camera you are going to use and have received it, ensure you are familiar with how it works. Each make of camera will be different, but make sure you take the time to get to know yours before using it for acquiring specimen photos.Here is a checklist of things to do before taking images of specimens:

1) **Set the date and time.** Make sure these are correct – affects file naming (see below).\
2) If available, set up **sensor cleaning.**\
3) Work out how to access the manual **controls** of the camera - this will probably involve taking it out of “P” or “Programme” mode and selecting “M” for “Manual”. You will want to be able to alter:
a - ISO sensitivity\
b - White balance\
c - Shutter speed\
d - Aperture\
e - Focus\
4) Set the **output image format**. It is strongly recommended to set this to the Raw format.\
5) Set the **file naming protocol**. A numbering system that determines how each file taken will be saved. Recommend setting this to the format YYYY-MM-DD. With this format the name of every picture taken on the 10th of January 2022 will start 2022-01-10. Photos will then be tagged with a number indicating which picture they were taken on that day. For example, the first photo will be 2022-01-10-00001, the 30th will be 2022-01-10-00030, and the 258th will be 2022-01-10-00258. This makes it easy to find pictures if you know on which day they were taken and will automatically organise the files when sorting them by name as all photos with the same prefix will group. Additionally, if you are using multiple cameras at the same time you should include a camera body identifier in file names, otherwise you could get duplicated file names. Consistent file naming is essential for data management and sharing (see data mobilisation module).\
6) **Cables** – check you have the necessary cables to connect your camera to both: 1) the mains power; 2) and to your computer. Cables are often standardised between makes and models, but its worth checking that your camera and computer are compatible with your connecting cables. This is especially crucial if equipment is updated as cable ports unfortunately change over time.

Details on how to do each of these steps should be found in the manual included with your camera. If you have lost your manual they can be often found online. Partiualry useful is youtube which contains several videos of how to use some of the main camera brands  Check [https://www.butkus.org/chinon/](https://www.butkus.org/chinon/) which has a wide range of downloadable camera manuals.

## Depth of field
A consideration when photographing 3D specimens is depth of field - the distance between the lens and parts of an object that are in focus. Depth of field is determined by the camera’s aperture setting (see glossary), lens focal length, and the distance to the subject.

![Callomon depth of field exmaple](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/depth_of_field_example.PNG?raw=true)

The effect of depth of field. Both pictures are taken of the same specimen using the same camera but using different apertures (left, f3.2; right, f32). The smaller aperture creates better contrast and clarity in the image but also required seven times as much light. Image from [Callomon 2021](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350530306_A_basic_guide_to_specimen_photography_in_museum_collections).

**Increase depth of field**
* Narrow your aperture (larger f-number)
* Move farther from the subject (less in frame)
* Shorten focal length (zoom, or change prime)\
**Decrease depth of field**
* Widen your aperture (smaller f-number)
* Move closer to the subject (more in frame)
* Lengthen your focal length\

It is tempting to think that all that needs to be done is to “stop down” the lens to its narrowest aperture (often f/32) but beyond a certain point whilst you will gain depth of field, the overall resolution of the image will be limited by diffraction. Lenses are usually sharpest closed down around three stops from the maximum aperture. f/16 is often given as an ideal aperture for scientific work.

While the aperture can be altered to optimise the depth of view, some specimens will simply have too great a 3D size to be captured the specimen in focus in a single photo.

For example, the photos below are shot with the same depth of field but focused over different distances. In the left photo the fly’s head is in focus, but not its abdomen. The right photo the abdomen is in focus, but not its head. Taken by [Muhammad Mahdi Karim](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Muhammad_Mahdi_Karim)

![fly_depths](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/fly_limited_depth_of_field.png?raw=true)

In some cases, such as this, the issue of depth of view on 3D-objects can be resolved by image stacking:

![stacked_fly_photo](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/stacked_fly.png?raw=true)

Depth of field is a highly complex factor to control. If you are interested check out this very [thorough account of depth of field](https://www.largeformatphotography.info/articles/DoFinDepth.pdf)

## Resolution
The quality and clarity of an image is determined by its resolution. Digital images are displayed on screens using pixels, and the image displayed is created by controlling the colour/brightness of each pixel. The more pixels making up a screen, the more fine detail the image can depict. Below we have a series of images of different resolutions each attempting to show the same letter R.

![R resolution exmaple](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/Resolution_illustration.png?raw=true)

This shows series of square images composed of different numbers of pixels. The numbers above each picture indicate the length and breadth of each image in pixels. Source: [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Resolution_illustration.png).\
\
We can see how the clarity of the image increases from left to right. The right-hand image is composed of 10,000 pixels (100x100) and therefore has a far greater resolution than the other images. In digitisation, we typically want to produce high-resolution images of specimens which contain fine details for analysis and specimen comparison.

For example consider these two similar images showing a specimen of the butterfly *Colias hyale*:

![two images of the different resolution](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/high_low_res_image1.png?raw=true)

These two images were taken with the same camera and with the same settings (1/80, f/10, 400). However, the one on the left is the camera's RAW format using its maximum resolution (~50Mp). The one on the right was saved as a .jpeg using a much lower resolution (0.046Mp - the camera’s lowest setting). When viewing the two pictures at this scale, they appear very similar - the specimen can be seen clearly and the label is readable. This could tempt us to use the lower resolution since the space taken up by this file is  only 1/415 the size of the higher resolution image (164Kb vs 68,216Kb).

However, lower resolution means a loss of finer detail. In the series of images below, the same area of each image is shown comparing the same space in both high and low resolution images. The top row is the high quality image and the bottom row is the low quality image.

![zoomed in images of different resolution](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/low_vs_high_res.png?raw=true)

The resolution is typically expressed in megapixels, i.e. the number of million pixels the camera has available to create an image. Generally, the greater the number of megapixels available to the camera, the greater quality and clarity the image will have. While the number of megapixels the average camera can utilise has increased greatly in recent times, any image of 12 megapixels or greater is satisfactory for digitisation, although images of at least >20 megapixels are now common.

Although more pixels means better quality images, more pixels also results in larger images, which take up more storage space and are slower to transfer. Also, an increase in image quality may not be observable for some users if their display screen is not also of a high resolution or if the image is not zoomed in enough. When deciding on an image size in megapixels it is important to consider these other factors rather than chasing ever higher numbers of pixels.

## File types
Digital images are produced and stored in many different ways which gives rise to a number of different file formats which can be confusing.
The standard output from a digital camera for digitisation is the RAW format. A RAW image is the purest version of what the camera sees, and RAW images have not been altered, compressed, or encrypted in any manner. For specimen digitisation, it is **strongly advised** to shoot and acquire all initial photos from the camera in the RAW format. Doing so means that even if alterations occur to shared copies the original photo still exists and can be used for analysis.

RAW files are typically very large and are not therefore typically used for file sharing through online portals. To address this, photos are often processed and converted into another picture format such as a .tiff or. jpg (see below). This is often done during post-image processing steps such as cropping or colour/white balance correction. Post-image processing also allows idiosyncrasies between cameras RAW output to be accounted for making photos taken on different setups easier to compare. The conversion of images to other file formats results in file compression, of which there are two forms:

**Lossless compression** – algorithm that preserves a perfect copy of an original image while reducing file size (e.g. TIFF)\
**Lossy compression** – algorithm that doesn’t preserve a perfect copy of original image while reducing file size (e.g. JPEG)
For long-term archival storage of images it is recommended to use a lossless compression format such as TIFF.

Whatever file format is used for uploading data for digital access, it's important to shoot and save photos in a RAW format before processing photos for analysis and accessibility.

### Abbreviations of photo file versions
Unfortunately, abbreviations are quite common in computational topics such as files name extensions. It’s not greatly important how each file type is different other than knowing which type you want to store or publish data as. File types can typically be converted from one to the other and can be generated from the original RAW file if needed.

Photo extension names either refer to the way in which a file type stores data (e.g. .tiff) or the group who created it (e.g. .jpg).

![Table_of_file-types_and_compression](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/compression_table.png?raw=true)

## Light
In specimen photography it is essential to have a consistent source and level of light. Each image should be taken under the same lighting conditions. This allows comparisons to be made between images as all light is standardised.

There are broadly three attributes that need to be considered when you are specifying lighting. These are:\
1) Intensity
2) Colour temperature
3) Quality

Intensity is the most obvious of these, we need enough light to see what we are doing. However from a conservation point of view, for many objects light causes cumulative and irreparable damage such as fading and embrittlement. This is why most museums and art galleries employ subdued lighting, and window blinds. Many conservation manuals suggest a general light level of 200 lux. Light is measured in lumens and lux, but these units are generally not used in photography. You can read more useful background [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(unit))

For photography, we will generally use light that is brighter than normal display conditions, but this is acceptable as the duration of exposure to this level of light will be very short. It therefore follows that you should not leave objects under bright lights for longer than needed - use a dummy object to perfect your setup and make the switch at the last moment. If you are particularly concerned about any objects, consult your conservator.

Colour temperature controls how warm or cold the light feels. Contrast the cold clinical lights in a lab or hospital to the cosy, warm atmosphere of a country pub with candles and a log fire. The colour temperature of overcast daylight, although somewhat variable, is often held up as being “neutral” and is what human eyes are used to seeing.

The colour temperature can affect the appearance of the specimen image. Imaging set ups should use a neutral Kelvin level that maintains accurate colouration as much as possible while also being well lit and bright.  Something in the region of 4000 to 5500 is ideal. Kelvin can be measured using either a spectrometer (often very expensive), or alternatively this is usually stated on lightbulbs. It is also possible to get a measure of Kelvin from the camera itself.

![representation of light colour scale](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/kelvin_scale.png?raw=true)

Sources of ambient light - lighting in the studio, coming in through the windows - will cause a condition known as “mixed lighting” and will change the colour correctness of the image. Unless you are using strobes/flash, all of that will matter. Camera rigs and light boxes that can help remove sources of ambient light are an excellent way to get consistent light levels in images.

A good way to check if you have mixed lighting is to take two photos, camera settings locked, one lights on, other lights off. Ideally the lights on image are properly exposed, the lights off image should be as close to black as possible.

**Light quality** is less commonly known about but is dependent on the spectral power distribution of a light source. You can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_power_distribution), but to use an audio analogy, imagine going to hear your favourite band live, but the bass player has forgotten to turn their amplifier on - what you hear is a poor rendition because a part of the audio spectrum is missing. In photography, light quality is encapsulated in a value referred to as Colour Rendering Index, or CRI - you will find this value in the technical datasheets issued by lighting manufacturers. Images taken under low-CRI light will lack subtle differentiation between tones, e.g. between dark navy blue and black. **For photography use, you should aim for a CRI of at least 90.**

### Which lights should you buy?
This is a complex and sometimes contentious issue, as there are so many issues to consider - but as long as your light meets the criteria outlined at the start of this section, there are a number of choices you could make. In recent years there has been significant crossover between the sectors of photography and cinematography, and as a result, many light types can now be considered as “dual-purpose”.

![table of different lighting sources](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/lighting_table.png?raw=true)


## Colour and white balance
The previous section raises one of the key issues with digital photography – light affects image colour and is inconsistent. Light affects the colour, as does the camera, and the screen on which an image is viewed. This is a serious problem for digitisation efforts as we wish to capture specimens in the most accurate way possible and in a way that is comparable between specimens, cameras, set ups, and other collections.

The solution to this is to use colour standards or a white balance chart to calibrate images. These are composed of spots of colour or white/grey scale shade that have specific reflective ranges. Colour/brightness is observed when different wavelengths of light are reflected by an image. Standards which reflect certain wavelengths and quantities can be used to correctly colour images by comparison. Digitally displayed colours can be described using several predefined systems such as a colours RAL (link of description) or a hex number which is unique to a specific colour and shade. The colour and whiteness of an image can be corrected on the computer when these values are known for included standards.

Standards can simply be a white/grey scale used to control the brightness or reflectance of an image while other are larger palettes with a range of colours. These are more useful when colour is an aim of the specimen’s image capture:

image ![shade and colour pallates](.png)

Palettes and standards can be bought [online](https://www.xrite.com/) and are a standard feature in photography. Prices generally range between £50 and £100 which may seem a bit steep for what seems like a bit of card, but they are important to produce quality and comparable digital images of specimens.

## Photography set ups
From the above sections you can see that there is a lot to consider when setting up specimen photography. A useful way to standardise and control your digitisation imaging is to have a dedicated set up and camera rig connected to a computer, for example:

image ![photo of single camera set up  - insects or slides](.png)\
Image ![photo of a herbarium set up](.png)

A set up like this allows you to standardise the light in each image, avoid external or fluctuating light sources, have a consistent defined image size, a stable shot, and even a scale when the camera is a defined distance from the object. All these aspects make the images captured more consistent between days and setups and improve the quality of analysis that can be performed upon digitised images.

### What to include in the photo?
When setting up your imaging setup you also need to consider what you would like to include in the photo. Here is a list of what you should be capturing in each image:\
1) **The specimen.** Including the whole specimen (or as much as possible) in the image. Images should aim to be centred on the specimen and not have it cramped up to any of the sides.
2) **Specimen labels.** Labels contain all the additional metadata on the specimen and are vital to include. Often the label information is even more important than physical details of the specimen itself. Make sure they are readable.
3) **Colour/white balance chart.** To ensure than colours are standardised include a colour chart or a white balance chart. This can help correct photos to the correct balance later. If chart of not included then use a background of a known colour and shade to standardise images.\
4) **Scale.** Include a scale so that the size of the specimen is known. This can be physical or can be added in later image processing if the camera is a known distance from the specimen.
5) **Barcodes.** If barcodes have been added to specimens make sure these are readable. These can be read by the computer, provide additional information, and help contrast digital databases.
6) **Background.** Make sure the background of the image is plain (white or grey) with no additional patterns. For specimens such as herbarium sheets the background will be the sheet itself which may have markings which is unavoidable.

## Taking photos with the computer
In most digitisation workflows images are captured using a tethering program on a computer. The camera and computer are linked using a cable. Most major camera brands have tethering programs that automatically launch when the camera is connected. An example of one is shown here:

![annotated tethring diagram](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/tethering_settings.png?raw=true)

The advantage of such programs is that the camera can be left untouched during the image capture process. Manual touching of the camera could inadvertently move the position of the camera or a change in settings. Photo settings can also be set on the computer which can often be clearer and more obvious to do than on the camera itself.

Finally, the ‘live view’ available on most tethering programs is useful for showing what the camera sees without looking through the lens. This is particularly useful when the camera is fixed in an awkward position, as is typical with photography rigs.

![live camera view exmaple](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/live_screen.png?raw=true)

In this view, we can look through the camera from the comfort of the computer screen which enables us to test the settings and framing of the image we are going to take.

## Computer programs for automation
Images captured by the camera via the tethering program are automatically placed into a folder on your computer. It’s recommended to have a new folder for photos taken on a specific day to avoid confusion (name folders with the date). You can also keep track of the photos by ensuring that the number of photos in the folder is what you expect from the number of specimens that have been processed.

However, taking the image is only the first step in the digitisation process. We’ll cover more in our module on data mobilisation but here we’ll cover a few steps and processes to help prepare your images for sharing.

### Barcode reading
Barcoding is a standard step in digitisation. Barcodes are used to assign unique identifiers to specimens, as well as to indicate their physical location within collections and additional information such as the specimen collector, place or origin or type status.

![annotated barcode image](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/annotated_barcode_image.png?raw=true)

Programs such as [**BardecodeFiler**](https://www.bardecode.com/en1/app/bardecodefiler/) can read barcodes (2D or 3D) from images. It can use these to read which species the image depicts and create a digital record for that image. For example, the image of slide below:

![herbarium sheet with many barcodes](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/many_barcode_herbarium_example.png)

Each barcode tells us something different. By using ‘hot folders’ the process of barcode reading can be automated as each photo is passed to BarcodeFiler as soon as the photo appears in the folder. Barcodefiler is also able to split barcodes when several specimens appear in the same image, for example:

### Auto-cropping
Specimen photographs often contain extra information that we don’t want to publish like drawer numbers, storage location, bar codes etc. For example consider this picture:

![pre cropped slide](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/pre-cropped_slide.png?raw=true)

The information at the top of this picture is unnecessary or even a security risk as it the barcodes on the right include where the specimen is stored within the museum. Such sensitive information can be removed by cropping.

![slide post cropping](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/cropped_slide.png?raw=true)

This process can be automated if images are in a series and the image size and the location of cropped information is standardised. The above example was performed using [**XnConvert**](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert/) and can automatically cut a specified number of pixels from each photo that is taken.

### Automated text reading
A major area of interest for digitisation is the potential for automatic transcription and the reading of specimen labels by artificial intelligence software. A lot of time is spent transcribing label information from images to produce detailed electronic records of each specimen. Computer programs have been developed to read text and translate this into electronic records, however this currently works much better with printed labels rather than handwritten ones. The technology is not currently good enough to be used on mass with digitisation efforts but improvements continue to be made and this may be a valuable and time-saving feature in the future. An example of such developments is described [here](https://riojournal.com/article/58030/)

## Glossary of technical photography terms and their relationships
Photography comes with a lot of jargon terms and abbreviations. To help make sense of these, we have tried to explain a few of the more common photography terms below. These should help in understanding the advice of specimen workflows and other photography materials.

**The exposure triangle**\
The main three terms used in photography are **ISO**, **aperture**, and **shutter speed**. All three affect the **exposure** of a photo, that is the amount of light that a camera has available to generate an image. A photo with too little light will be dark or unfocused, but too much light will result in an overexposed photo of un-focussed bright spots.

To illustrate the different components of photo exposure we will make comparison to this well exposed photo:

![base settings image for comparison](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/base_settings_F_10_ISO400.JPG?raw=true)

This image shows a single specimen of *Colias hyale* (the pale clouded yellow) The exposure settings used were: shutter speed = 1/80; ISO = 400, and aperture f/10. We will now explore how each of these three factors affects the images produced.

**ISO** – standing for ‘International Organization for Standardization’, ISO values typically range between 200 and 2000 and is a measure of the camera’s sensitivity to light. The higher the ISO the brighter a photo will be. Specimen imaging workflows use a range of ISO depending on the specimen and available lighting. For example, our herbarium sheet workflow uses a lower ISO value of 200 since additional light sources mean too high an ISO would produce an overexposed image. ISO stands for International Organization for Standardization.
Unless you have a good reason not to, you should keep the ISO as low as possible. Increasing the ISO not only amplifies the image data (the signal) but also unwanted random data off the sensor (the noise). It is preferable to keep the signal-to-noise-ratio as low as possible.

Altering the ISO in our example photo from before, we can see the effect different ISO values have on the image.

In each of these images the shutter speed and aperture are unchanged from the original photo (1/80, f/10), but with different ISO values. Starting with the top image and then left to right, the ISO in each image is: 100, 1000, 3200. You’ll see that the higher the ISO the brighter the image is as the sensor is more sensitive to light that is coming into the camera.

**Shutter speed** – how long the shutter of the camera is open, allowing light to enter the camera. The length of time the shutter is open controls the exposure of the shot.
Shutter speed is measured by the length of time the shutter is open, usually in fractions of a second, e.g. 1/200, 1/100, 1/80 etc.

Look at these images of our example specimen which were taken with different shutter speeds.

Clockwise starting from the top left, the shutter speeds used were: 1/6, 1/30, 1/1600, 1/800. Remember that these are expressed in fractions of a second , meaning that an shutter speed of ⅙ mean s that the shutter is open for much longer than a shutter speed of 1/800. The longer the shutter is open, the more light falls on the sensor, creating a brighter image.

**Aperture** – the size of the opening in the lens through which light passes. Controls how much and the area of light that enters. Aperture affects the depth of field of a photo (see below). Aperture is measured as a f-number, written as f/##. A smaller f-number, e.g. f/1.4, indicates a larger aperture, whereas a larger number, e.g. f/16, indicates a smaller aperture.

Again, below we show a series of images taken with different aperture sizes.

![photos of different aperture](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/comp_arpeture.png?raw=true)

Clockwise from top left the aperture sizes are: f/3.2, f/7.1, f/14, and f/25. The larger the aperture, the more light enters the camera and the brighter the image is.

### Exposure summary
The ISO, aperture, and shutter speed all affect the exposure (i.e. the amount of light) in different ways and need to be optimised and balanced to create a decent specimen image. The images below all have different settings, but the resultant image is almost the same in each one as the different settings are balanced.

The different camera settings can be confusing to get your head around. The following figure should help with this and summarises the effect of each factor. However, following the specifications in established workflows will hopefully prevent you from taking under or over exposed photos.

## Concluding, references and other sources
This module aimed to give a better understanding of the factors involved in specimen photography and should help you with your own digitisation efforts. This page is not and definitive source of information, but should give you a good starting point to build your understanding. Different specimen types and situation may require alternative approaches to those we've covered here.\
