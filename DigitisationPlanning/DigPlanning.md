# Digitisation Planning

This page provides a checklist of areas to consider when planning a digitisation project. It includes digitisation strategy and planning, how to prioritise areas of the collection to digitise, potential costs and staffing.

Planning a digitisation project or programme for an institution can sometimes be seen as a daunting activity. Whilst there are many activities and preparations which need to be considered, it is possible to carry out some basic planning and then carry out small pilot projects to develop the planning as an iterative process.

For the planning process, the following checklist provides guidance on the activities and tasks that should be considered. Guidance on digitisation itself can be found in the Digitisation section. We are still working to add information to this page, so please check back soon!

## Digitisation Strategy
<details>
	<summary><strong>Click here to expand</strong></summary>
	<p>A digitisation strategy provides a high-level blueprint for the digitisation of the collections within a specific timeline. It would normally include sections covering the vision, the reasons for digitising, 
	the intended users of the digitised specimens, the scope and prioritisation, the strategic objectives and metrics of success and impact. Additional sections may also include policy and legal
	aspects, mission and principles.</p>
	<p> Examples of digitisation strategies include:</p>

	<p>A digitisation plan provides a detailed, quantifiable and measurable plan of work. It would normally define specific objectives, activities, targets, responsibilities and deadlines for 
	delivering your digitisation strategy.</p>
